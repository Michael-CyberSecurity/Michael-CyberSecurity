## Hi there üëã

I‚Äôm currently seeking jobs related to Cyber Security/Information Security/IT Risk in New Zealand. GitHub readme extends my resume by showcasing my InfoSec GRC experience, Cyber Security background, SOC, Penetration Testing, IT Governance experience, Other IT skills, as well as my hobbies and personality.

- üëØ InfoSec GRC--Designed and implemented security systems from the ground up, aligning with ISO 27001 requirements and objectives while integrating industry best practices to achieve its security goals, including:
  1) Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BCP): Ensured resilience by integrating NIST SP 800-34 Rev.1, ISO/IEC 27031, and ISO/TS 22317 contingency planning guidelines.
  2) Risk Management Framework: Applied NIST SP 800-30, NIST CSF 2.0, ISCSI IT Asset Valuation, Risk Assessment & Control Model, and CVSS to enhance risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
  3) Incident Management: Strengthened security incident response by aligning NIST SP 800-61 Rev.3, and NIST CSF 2.0 recommendations.
  4) Secure System Development & Acquisition: Enforced secure development including security coding, secure development environment, security of version control, security testing and procurement processes by integrating OWASP, and ISO 27002 guidelines.
  5) Additionally, implemented ISO 27002 to support security objectives in key areas, including: Organization of Information Security, Asset Management, Supplier Relationships, Human Resource Security, Operations Security, and Access Control.

- üå± Designed and Built Business-Driven Cyber Security Architecture (see the three key points below)
- 1- Referenced SABSA enterprise architecture framework to design and build five security architecture layers from different perspectives:
  1) The Business's  view --  Contextual Security Architecture 
  2) The Architect's view -- Conceptual Security Architecture
  3) The Designer's  view -- Logical Security Architecture (high-level)
  4) The builder's   view --  Physical & Component Security Architecture (lower-level)
  5) The FacilityManager's view -- Operational Security Architecture
- 2- Established strong connections between the five layers to help business owners clearly understand enterprise risks and align security strategy with business decisions.
- 3- Physical & Component Security Architecture (lower-level) and Operation Security Architecture ‚Äì implemented measures include:
  1) Data Security: Implemented the 5A Methodology and developed three key security architectures: Product Security Architecture, Security Technology Architecture, and Audit Architecture. Applied NIST Data Security Framework and PCI DSS standards for comprehensive data protection.
  2) Secure engineering & Application Security: Led secure engineering initiatives by embedding security into the software development lifecycle through threat modeling, secure coding, and security testing. Drove the adoption of OWASP Secure Coding Practices, focusing on input validation, output encoding, authentication and password management, session management, error handling, and database security. Strengthened application security posture by implementing configurations aligned with CIS Benchmarks.
  3) Cryptography: Based on CISSP standards and Cryptography and Network Security: Principles and Practice (Pearson), strengthened the cryptosystem by optimizing algorithms, ensuring key secrecy, selecting appropriate key lengths, and using initialization vectors to achieve ideal confusion and diffusion. Analysed cipher suites and selected suitable options for enterprise applications.
  4) Communications Security: Designed and implemented a Robust Security Network (RSN) with IEEE 802.11i for wireless security. Analysed common network attacks and performed security hardening on routers, switches, and firewalls, following vendor best practices.
  5) System Security: In alignment with CIS standards, led secure hardening initiatives for Linux, AIX, Windows, Apple Server Systems, Virtualization, Cloud Computing, and NAS/SAN Storage to ensure comprehensive security across diverse platforms.
  6) AAA: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting ‚Äî using RADIUS for initial authentication, integrated with EAP methods such as EAP-TLS/PEAP, PKI for certificate-based access, Kerberos for Single Sign-On (SSO), and LDAP for centralized identity management.
  7) Operation Security Architecture ‚Äì implemented through ‚ö° Internal SOC and üî≠ Penetration Testing (see details below):
    
- ‚ö° Internal SOC (Security Operation Center) 
  1) Designed and implemented an enterprise SOC architecture integrating SIEM (Splunk), Logstash, and Salesforce (later migrated to ServiceNow) to centralize incident tracking and workflow automation.
  2) Ingested and normalized security logs from multiple data sources including Palo Alto firewalls, McAfee endpoint security, Windows Event Logs, and WatchGuard Email Security (spam, phishing, and malware attachment).
  3) Developed and maintained use cases to generate automated security alerts and improve threat detection.
  4) Conducted static and dynamic malware analysis in sandbox environments to identify malicious behaviors and enhance detection rule accuracy.
  5) Performed incident analysis, and threat validation, continuously fine-tuning detection rules to minimize false positives and false negatives.
  6) Provided analytical feedback to vendors (e.g., Palo Alto) to improve security product detection accuracy and contribute to the broader cybersecurity community.

- üî≠ Penetration Testing
  1) Follow PTES and OWASP frameworks to conduct web application and network Penetration Testing.
  2) Perform information gathering, threat modelling, vulnerability identification, exploitation, and post-exploitation (privilege escalation, process migration, security products and services evasion, persistence, lateral movement).
  3) Wireless security ‚Äî assess WPA2, WPA and WEP deployments and detect rogue/fake access points.
  4) Network segmentation & exposure testing ‚Äî evaluate segmentation controls and identify enterprise sensitive-data exposure to the public Internet.
  5) Conduct phishing simulations with malware attachment testing to evaluate user awareness


- üå± Designed and Built Business-Driven Data Security Architecture
- 1- Contextual Security Architecture (Business View ‚Äì SABSA EA): At Baoneng Motor, a key stakeholder requirement stated that ‚Äúenterprise sensitive information must not be used, disclosed, altered, or deleted without authorization.‚Äù As data security was the primary concern, a dedicated Data Security Architecture was developed independently from the overall Cyber Security Architecture, referencing the TOGAF framework.
- 2- Data Security Architecture consists of three sub-domain architectures:
