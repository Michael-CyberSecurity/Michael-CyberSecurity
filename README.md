## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently seeking jobs related to Cyber Security/Information Security/IT Risk in New Zealand. GitHub readme extends my resume by showcasing my InfoSec GRC experience, Cyber Security background, IT Governance experience, Other IT skills, as well as my hobbies and personality.

- ðŸ‘¯ InfoSec GRC--Designed and implemented security systems from the ground up, aligning with ISO 27001 requirements and objectives while integrating industry best practices to achieve its security goals, including:
  1) Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BCP): Ensured resilience by integrating NIST SP 800-34 Rev.1, ISO/IEC 27031, and ISO/TS 22317 contingency planning guidelines.
  2) Risk Management Framework: Applied NIST SP 800-37 Rev.2, NIST CSF 2.0, ISCSI IT Asset Valuation, Risk Assessment & Control Model, and CVSS to enhance risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
  3) Incident Management: Strengthened security incident response by aligning NIST SP 800-61 Rev.3, and NIST CSF 2.0 recommendations.
  4) Secure System Development & Acquisition: Enforced secure development including security coding, secure development environment, security of version control, security testing and procurement processes by integrating OWASP, and ISO 27002 guidelines.
  5) Additionally, implemented ISO 27002 to support security objectives in key areas, including: Organization of Information Security, Asset Management, Supplier Relationships, Human Resource Security, Operations Security, and Access Control.

- ðŸŒ± Designed and Built Cyber Security Architecture
  1) Data Security: Implemented the 5A Methodology and developed three key security architectures: Product Security Architecture, Security Technology Architecture, and Audit Architecture. Applied NIST Data Security Framework and PCI DSS standards for comprehensive data protection.
  2) Secure engineering & Application Security: Led secure engineering initiatives by embedding security into the software development lifecycle through threat modeling, secure coding, and security testing. Drove the adoption of OWASP Secure Coding Practices, focusing on input validation, output encoding, authentication and password management, session management, error handling, and database security. Strengthened application security posture by implementing configurations aligned with CIS Benchmarks.
  3) Cryptography: Based on CISSP standards and Cryptography and Network Security: Principles and Practice (Pearson), strengthened the cryptosystem by optimizing algorithms, ensuring key secrecy, selecting appropriate key lengths, and using initialization vectors to achieve ideal confusion and diffusion. Analysed cipher suites and selected suitable options for enterprise applications.
  4) Communications Security: Designed and implemented a Robust Security Network (RSN) with IEEE 802.11i for wireless security. Analysed common network attacks and performed security hardening on routers, switches, and firewalls, following vendor best practices.
  5) System Security: In alignment with CIS standards, led secure hardening initiatives for Linux, AIX, Windows, Apple Server Systems, Virtualization, Cloud Computing, and NAS/SAN Storage to ensure comprehensive security across diverse platforms.
  6) AAA: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting â€” using RADIUS for initial authentication, integrated with EAP methods such as EAP-TLS/PEAP, PKI for certificate-based access, Kerberos for Single Sign-On (SSO), and LDAP for centralized identity management.
     
- ðŸ’¬ IT Governance
  1)	Assisted the Chief Information Officer (CIO) in planning activities, including the annual work plan of the Information Management Center, performance evaluations, and the development of IT governance documentation.
  2)	Acted as PMO role in designing and building IT project management systems aligned with PMP standards. Managed projects through all six stages: preparation, initiation, planning, implementation, go-live preparation and closure;
  3)	Acted as PMO role in designing and monitoring key project deliverables for each project stages including during the first stage (Project Preparation), focused on the Project Proposal and Business Case; in the second stage (Project Initiation), handled the Project Charter, Statement of Work (SOW), Contractor Management, Technical/Requirement Specification Document, Supplier Tendering, and Project Kickoff Meeting; the third stage (Project Planning) included the Business Blueprint, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Requirement and Prototype Confirmation, Architecture Validation, and Detailed Design and Testing Solution Analysis; the fourth stage (Project Implementation) involved the setup of development and testing environments, system development, unit testing, integration testing, and system testing; the fifth stage (Go-Live Preparation) covered User Acceptance Testing (UAT), system cutover plan, knowledge transfer, handover to the operations team, and operations readiness; and the final stage (Project Closure) included the official system go-live, final handover, project retrospective, and resource release.
  4)	Assisted in project permission management, risk assessment, and progress monitoring using the ZenTao tool, ensuring alignment with organizational objectives. 

- ðŸ“« IT Infrastructure and Web Application Architecture
  1) Server: Experienced in maintaining and hardening Windows, Linux, AIX, and macOS servers
  2) Active Director: Skilled in designing and troubleshooting complex AD environments (multi-domain/site), Group Policy, RBAC, domain trusts, and IAM integration.
  3) Cloud: Experienced in deploying and troubleshooting private clouds using OpenStack. Hands-on with public Clouds such as AWS and Alibaba Cloud, including instance management, hardening, and security control implementation.
  4) Docker: Familiar with Docker networking and commands; experienced in Dockerfile creation and container deployment.
  5) Virtualization: Proficient in Hyper-V clustering; experienced with KVM and VMware vSphere maintenance.
  6) Storage: Experienced with EMC and IBM San storage arrays, as well as the distributed storage system MogileFS.
  7) Database: Basic DBA skillsâ€”MySQL backup, replication, transaction handling, caching (Memcached/Redis), and HA (MHA, Redis Sentinel).
  8) Web Infrastructure: Optimized LNMP stacks for performance, availability, and cost-efficiency using HAProxy, Varnish, Nginx, Keepalived, MHA, Redis, and MogileFS.
  9) Monitoring: Used Zabbix for infrastructure monitoring (e.g., CPU, network, disk)
  10) Automated deployment and configuration management: Used Puppet for automated server deployment, configuration, and drift correction.
      
- ðŸ˜„ Hobbies&Personality: I'm a good dancer! I'm a social person who enjoys meeting new friends. I love animals and embracing nature. I'm also interested in Maori's culture and hope to have the opportunity to contribute to the Mario community.
